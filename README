This is code for an Atmel ATMEGA88 for a PS2 and PS3 controller board. It was intended to be built into an arcade stick.
As far as I know it works fine on real PS1, PS2 and PS3 hardware, as well as PC.

Based on my notes (not checked!) the pinout for an atmega88 is as follows:

1: RST
2: L1 (D0)
3: L2 (D1)
4: PS (D2)
5: USB- / PSX ACK (D3)
6: USB+ / PSX ATT (D4)
7: VCC
8: GND
9: XTAL
10: XTAL
11: L (D5)
12: R (D6)
13: D (D7)
14: U (B0)

15: R1 (B1)
16: R2 (B2)
17: MOSI (B3)
18: MISO (B4)
19: SCK (B5) (pull down with big resistor)
20: VCC
21: NC
22: GND
23: Tr (C0)
24: Ci (C1)
25: X  (C2)
26: Sq (C3)
27: St (C4)
28: Sel (C5)

Button names are for the Playstation side. USB- and USB+ are for V-USB. MOSI, MISO, SCK, PSX ACK and PSX ATT are the
data lines for the Playstation controller connector. At some point I might look up how pull-up and pull-down resistors
were set up.

There's some stuff in mapping.h that can be configured from the makefile to adjust button mappings. These were hacked
in to work around mistakes when the boards were installed in physical sticks. I think ICANTREAD was due to buttons being
connected to the wrong pins, and INVERTTRIGGERS was because of some circuitry required to get the PCB to play nice in
parallel with an Xbox 360 controller, all crammed inside a Namco PS1 arcade stick.
